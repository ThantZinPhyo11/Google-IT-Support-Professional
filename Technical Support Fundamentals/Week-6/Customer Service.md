# Technical Support Fundamentals | Week-6

## Customer Service

### Question 1

You're doing desktop support, and the company policy is that you can only help with company equipment. A user walks in:

Tech: Hi there, how can I help you?

User: My computer is really slow, and I can barely use it. Can you help me figure out what's wrong?

Tech: It looks like this is a personal computer. Are you talking about your work computer?

User: Uh, no, this is the one that I need help with. I figured you’re good with computers, and you could help. My daughter needs it for a school assignment that’s due tomorrow, but it's too slow for her to get anything done.

What would you do?


( Correct ) Explain why you can’t troubleshoot the issue, per the company policy. But give them some tips on what common issues could be slowing down his computer, and how they might go about fixing them. 

Tell them you can’t help them and suggest they go to a local tech store for help.

Politely tell them that it's against the company policy, and you can’t help them.

Forget about the policy and help them! 

Answer - This response sets expectations and then gives some helpful suggestions. Here, you're showing the user that you care about their issue, even if you can’t help them.


### Question 2

Situation: You work for a company that requires a visual verification when resetting passwords. The verification doesn't have to be done through your company account. However, you must see the person "live" (not through a picture), so that you can match them to their photo before resetting their account.

Scenario: Phone call

Anastasia: Thanks for calling. My name is Anastasia. How can I help you?

Ling: Hi, Anastasia. This is Ling. I need to reset my account password.

Anastasia: Hi, Ling. I’d be happy to help you with that, but first I need to verify your identity. Can you do a video call with me through Skype?

Ling: I can’t get into my work account. That's why I’m calling.

What would you do in this situation? Check all that apply.


Offer to set up a video call through Skype, Facetime, or Hangouts. ( Correct )

Ask the user if they have a personal account to use for Skype.

Suggest the user make a video call with you through their phone. ( Correct )

Kindly tell them they will have to wait until the next day to meet with someone live.

You didn’t select all the correct answers

Answer - You're all about thinking outside the box to figure out what else the user can do to set up that call. You could potentially suggest they go to an internet cafe or local library with wifi, too. 


### Question 3

A user needs their password reset. The IT Support Specialist is pulling up the necessary information while the user starts asking a bunch of questions: Why does the password have to have a capital and a symbol? Why can’t I write it down? Why does it change so often? Isn’t this a waste of time?

How would you respond to the user?


Kindly ask the user to stop asking questions, since you're trying to solve their problem.

Stop what you're doing and explain to the user that passwords should have numbers and symbols for security purposes, and this is more important than productivity.

( Correct ) Let the user know that you're working on their issue and will be sure to answer all of their questions once you're done.

Ignore the user and keep working on resetting the password, so you don’t lose your place.

Answer - You're acknowledging the user’s questions, but setting a clear agenda of what you want to accomplish. This allows them to understand what they should anticipate and helps you keep control of the conversation.


### Question 4

You receive the following ticket from a user: 

My machine is saying I have to reboot, but this is silly. I have a ton of processes running, I don’t want to have to reload everything. This is a waste of time. I’ve included a screenshot of the message. Please advise.

Hi Aditya,

Thanks for contacting support.

Please restart the computer, there are no other options in this case.

When installing programs, you need to reboot your machine.


I see that you’re concerned about rebooting your machine.

I looked into the screenshot you provided, and it appears the reboot is due to a new program you installed. In order for the program to run, a reboot has to be done.

It was a pleasure working with you. 

Regards,

Amelia


( Correct ) Thanks for contacting support. I see that you’re concerned about rebooting your machine.

Based on the screenshot you provided, it looks like you received the reboot prompt because a new program was installed. In order for the program to start working, you’ll need to reboot your machine. Is it possible to save your commands beforehand, so that you can get to them again?

Please let me know if there is anything further that I can help you with.

Regards, 

Amelia


Answer - You’re letting the user know that you’ve looked at the information they provided, explained why the reboot is needed, suggested a possible workaround to their concern, and left the door open in case there are more questions.


### Question 5

Situacion: You are working as an IT support specialist and receive the following request thorough chat:

Name: Yuki Saitō

Customer number: 674213

Issue: I need more bandwidth

Chat log:

Mia: Hi Yuki, how are you today? I see that you are concerned about needing more bandwidth. I’d be happy to help.

Yuki: Thanks, I really need it!

Mia: Can I ask what you mean by “needing more bandwidth?”

Yuki: I mean that everytime I try to use my computer after lunch, it’s incredibly slow. I think I’m using all the bandwidth in the morning.

What do you do next?


Suggest the user reboot his machine when this happens.

Tell the user that you have no control over their bandwidth and politely close the chat.

Ask more questions about what programs they’re using. ( Correct )

Give the user what they want. Increase their bandwidth and move on to the next user.


Answer - This response shows that you were paying attention to the little clues that people leave. The user mentions that this always happens after lunch. Pinpointing the programs used will help you better diagnose the issue faster.
