## Routing

### Question 1

Which of the following are types of Interior Gateway Protocols? (Select all that apply)


Link State Routing Protocols ( Correct )

Answer - Interior gateway protocols are split into two categories: link state routing protocols and distance-vector protocols.


Distance-Vector Protocols.  ( Correct )

Answer - Interior gateway protocols are split into two categories: link state routing protocols and distance-vector protocols.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Transmission Control Protocol


### Question 2

Who is permitted to use non-routable address space?


The IETF

Anyone  ( Correct )

The IANA

It's for testing purposes only

Answer - Anyone can use non-routable address space.


### Question 3

A typical routing table may contain which of the following? Check all that apply.


Destination address

Destination Network ( Correct )

Answer - Routing tables would contain a row for each network that the router knows about. This is just the definition of the remote network, a network ID, and the net mask.

Total Hops ( Correct )

Answer - A routing table entry needs to know how many hops away a destination network is.

TTL


### Question 4

What is the difference between Interior Gateway Protocols and Exterior Gateway Protocols?

There is no difference between them.

( Correct ) Interior Gateway Protocols share information within a single autonomous system. Exterior Gateway Protocols are used for the exchange of information between multiple autonomous systems.

Interior gateway protocols share information with multiple autonomous systems. Exterior Gateway Protocols are used for the exchange of information between independent autonomous systems.

Interior gateway protocols share information with public networks. Exterior gateway protocols are used for private networks.

Answer - Interior gateway protocols are used on organization networks. Exterior gateway protocols are used to share information across different organizations.


### Question 5

Which of the following are non-routable IP addresses? (Select all that apply)

192.168.0.0/16.  ( Correct )

Answer - RFC 1918 defined three ranges of IP addresses that belong to no one, so anyone can use them. The primary three ranges of non-routable address space are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. These ranges are free for anyone to use for their internal networks.

172.16.0.0/12  ( Correct )

Answer - RFC 1918 defined three ranges of IP addresses that belong to no one, so anyone can use them. The primary three ranges of non-routable address space are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. These ranges are free for anyone to use for their internal networks.

9.0.0.0

10.0.0.0/8
