# The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking | Week-1

## The Physical Layer

### Question 1

What modulation type is used for computer networks?


Simplex communication

Line crimping

RJ45

Line coding ( Correct )


Answer - Line coding is the modulation of an electrical charge so that each side of a connection knows what is a one and what is a zero.

### Question 2

What is the difference between full duplex and half duplex?


Full duplex is slower than half duplex.

( Correct ) Full duplex allows communications in two directions at the same time; half duplex means that only one side can communicate at a time.

Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.

Half duplex occurs when hubs are in use; full duplex occurs when switches are in use.

Answer - A half duplex connection allows communication in both directions, but only one side can communicate at a time.


### Question 3

The ____________ consists of devices and means of transmitting bits across computer networks.


data link layer

modulation

network layer

physical layer ( Correct )

Answer - The physical layer is the first layer of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model and is in charge of transmitting the bits across computer networks.

### Question 4

What is the most common type of cabling used for connecting computing devices?


VGA Cable

Twisted Pair Cable ( Correct )

Power Cable

SATA Cable

Answer - Twisted pair cable features pairs of copper wires that are twisted together.

### Question 5

Which of the following are category types of Twisted Pair Ethernet cable? (Select all that apply)


Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP). ( Correct )

Answer - The most common and least expensive type of Ethernet cable found in business and home networks.


Shielded Twisted Pair (STP). ( Correct )

Answer - An STP cable uses a braided aluminum and/or copper shielding to encase the four twisted pairs underneath the outer jacket.


Foiled Twisted Pair (FTP). ( Correct )

Answer - An FTP cable uses a thin foil shield that wraps around the bundle of twisted pair wires underneath the outer jacket.
