### Question 3

What is a cyclical redundancy check?


The actual data being transported by an Ethernet frame.

A way for two computers to synchronize their clocks.

A mathematical calculation used to ensure that all data arrived intact. ( Correct )

A technique that allows for multiple logical LANs to operate on the same equipment.


Answer - A cyclical redundancy check ensures that there was no data corruption.

### Question 4

Which of the following are ways for transmitting data at the Ethernet level? (Select all that apply)


Multicast ( Correct )

Answer - Multicast transmission is when one device transmits data to multiple devices. 

Broadcast ( Correct )

Answer - Broadcast transmission is when one device sends data to every single device on a LAN. 

Duplex

Unicast ( Correct )

Answer - Unicast transmission is when one device transmits data to another device. A unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.

### Question 5

Which of the following are parts of an Ethernet frame? (Select all that apply)


EtherType field ( Correct )

Answer - EtherType field is 16 bits long and used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame.

Preamble ( Correct )

Answer - The preamble is the first part of an Ethernet frame.


Data payload( Correct )

Answer - This contains all of the data from higher layers, such as IP, transport, and application layers, that's actually being transmitted.
