## Wireless Channels

### Question 

Wireless Channels

Let’s see how much you learned about wireless channels and how to select the optimal setup.

Here is the scenario: 

You’re an IT Support Specialist that has set up three wireless channels for a company. As time goes on, neighboring companies have their own wireless networks coming into operation. This causes network interference between your networks and their network.

1. You will see three wireless channels with access points that you control. The blue semicircle on the screen represents your wireless channels. You can drag these around on the screen using the black rectangle at the top of the bubble (click to select and move with the mouse to the desired position). When you select the blue semicircle, it will turn gray.

2. The semicircle called “Neighbor” represents the competing wireless networks.

3. Minimize network interference by moving your wireless channels so there’s as little overlap as possible for all wireless channels.

4. Once you’ve best positioned the wireless channels, click “Submit”. If your configuration is “correct,” the following messages will appear on top of the graphic:

5. If you successfully minimize the network interference, click the “Next” button, and you’ll respond to a new scenario. You have 5 scenarios to complete for this activity. If your answer is wrong, click “Reset” and try again.
