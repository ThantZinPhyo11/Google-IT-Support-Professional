# The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking | Week-3

## The Application Layer

### Question 1

Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.   

The session layer ( Correct )

The presentation layer ( Correct )

The interconnection layer

The compression layer

Answer - The session layer handles delivery of data from the transport layer to applications themselves.

Answer - The presentation layer might handle things like compression or encryption.

### Question 2

An example of something that operates at the application layer is: 

A web browser ( Correct )

UDP

TCP

A router

Answer - Web browsers and server operate at the application layer.

### Question 3

What's the standard number for a TTL field?

8

16

32

64 ( Correct )

Answer - While this value can be set to anything from 0 to 255, 64 is the recommended standard.


### Question 4

Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?

Networking stack ( Correct )

ARP message

The source port

The router

Answer - The networking stack is the part of the operating system responsible for handling networking functions.

### Question 5

Which section of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model contains the data the application wants to send?


The payload of the TCP segment ( Correct )

The header of the Ethernet frame

The payload section of the IP Datagram ( Correct )

The payload section of the Ethernet frame


Answer - The payload of the TCP segments has a generic data section which contains the data that is sent.
