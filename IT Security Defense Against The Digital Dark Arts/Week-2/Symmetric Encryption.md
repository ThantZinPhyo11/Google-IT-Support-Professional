## Symmetric Encryption

### Question 1

What are the components that make up a cryptosystem? Check all that apply.

Key generation algorithms ( Correct )

Decryption algorithms( Correct )

Encryption algorithms( Correct )

Transmission algorithms

Answer - Great job! A cryptosystem is a collection of algorithms needed to operate an encryption service. This involves generating encryption keys, as well as encryption and decryption operations.


### Question 2

What is steganography?

The study of stegosauruses

The practice of encoding messages

The study of languages

The practice of hiding messages ( Correct )

Answer - Yep! Steganography involves hiding messages, but not encoding them.


### Question 3

What makes an encryption algorithm symmetric? 

Very large key sizes

High speed 

Different keys used for encryption and decryption

The same keys used for encryption and decryption( Correct )

Answer - Awesome! The symmetry of a symmetric algorithm refers to one key being used for both encryption and decryption.


### Question 4

What's the difference between a stream cipher and a block cipher?

There is no difference.

Stream ciphers can't save encrypted data to disk.

Block ciphers are only used for block device encryption.

Stream ciphers encrypt data as a continuous stream, while block ciphers operate on chunks of data.( Correct )

Answer - You got it! A stream cipher takes data in as a continuous stream, and outputs the ciphertext as a continuous stream, too. A block cipher encrypts the data in chunks, or blocks.


### Question 5

True or false: The smaller the encryption key is, the more secure the encrypted data is.

TRUE

FALSE ( Correct )

Answer - Nice work! The reverse is true. The larger the key, the more secure the encrypted data will be.
