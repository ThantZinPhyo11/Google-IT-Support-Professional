# IT Security: Defense Against The Digital Dark Arts | Week-2

## Public Key or Asymmetric Encryption

### Question 1

Which of the following do asymmetric cryptography systems provide? Select all that apply.

Authenticity  ( Correct )

Availability 

Non-repudiation  ( Correct )

Confidentiality ( Correct )

Answer - Confidentiality is provided by the encryption and decryption functionality, while authenticity and non-repudiation are ensured by the signing and verification processes.


### Question 2

What advantage does asymmetric encryption have over symmetric encryption? 

They have very fast performance.

They're more secure.

They allow secure communication over untrusted channels. ( Correct )

They're easier to implement.

Answer - By exchanging public keys for encrypting data, asymmetric encryption securely exchanges information over untrusted channels.


### Question 3

What's a common application for asymmetric algorithms?

Secure key exchange  ( Correct )

Full disk encryption 

Random number generation

Secure password storage

Answer - Asymmetric encryption schemes are perfect for securely exchanging small amounts of data over untrusted networks by exchanging public keys that are used for encrypting data.


### Question 4

What do we call a bit of information that allows authentication of a received message?

Asymmetric encryption

MAC (Message Authentication Codes) ( Correct )

Symmetric encryption

RSA 

Answer - MAC is a bit of information that allows authentication of a received message, ensuring that the message came from the alleged sender and not a third party masquerading as them. It also ensures that the message wasn't modified in some way in order to provide data integrity.


### Question 5

Which form of encryption does the US NEST recommend?

NSA

EC ( Correct )

DH

DSA

Answer - The US NEST recommends using EC encryption, and the NSA allows its use to protect top secret data with 384 bit EC keys. But, the NSA has expressed concern about EC encryption being potentially vulnerable to quantum computing attacks, as quantum computing technology continues to evolve and mature.
