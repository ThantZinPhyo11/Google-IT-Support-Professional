# IT Security: Defense Against The Digital Dark Arts | Week-2

## Week Two Practice Quiz

### Question 1

Plaintext is the original message, while _____ is the encrypted message.

ciphertext ( Correct )

cipher

algorithm

digest

Answer - Once the original message is encrypted, the result is referred to as ciphertext.


### Question 2

The specific function of converting plaintext into ciphertext is called a(n) ______.

permutation

data protection standard

integrity check

encryption algorithm ( Correct )

Answer - An encryption algorithm is the specific function or steps taken to convert plaintext into encrypted ciphertext.


### Question 3

Studying how often letters and pairs of letters occur in a language is referred to as _______.

codebreaking

frequency analysis ( Correct )

espionage

cryptography

Answer - Frequency analysis involves studying how often letters occur and looking for similarities in ciphertext to uncover possible plaintext mappings.


### Question 4

The practice of hiding messages instead of encoding them is referred to as ______.

obfuscation

encryption

steganography ( Correct )

hashing

Answer - Steganography involves hiding messages from discovery instead of encoding them.


### Question 5

ROT13 and a Caesar cipher are examples of _______.

steganography

substitution ciphers ( Correct )

asymmetric encryption

digital signatures

Answer - These are both examples of substitution ciphers, since they substitute letters for other letters in the alphabet.


### Question 6

DES, RC4, and AES are examples of ______ encryption algorithms.

weak

strong

symmetric ( Correct )

asymmetric

Answer - DES, RC4, and AES are all symmetric encryption algorithms.


### Question 7

Which of the following are necessary components for encryption and decryption operations when using an asymmetric encryption system? Check all that apply.

Random number generator

Public key ( Correct )

Digest

Private key ( Correct )

Answer - In asymmetric encryption systems, there's a public key used for encryption, and a private key used for decryption.


### Question 8

To create a public key signature, use the ______ key.

symmetric

decryption

private ( Correct )

public

Answer - The private key is used to sign data. This allows a third party to verify the signature using the public key, ensuring that the signature came from someone in possession of the private key.


### Question 9

Using an asymmetric cryptosystem provides which of the following benefits? Check all that apply.

Hashing

Confidentiality ( Correct )

Non-repudiation ( Correct )

Authenticity ( Correct )

Answer - Confidentiality is provided by the encryption, authenticity is achieved through the use of digital signatures, and non-repudiation is also provided by digitally signing data.


### Question 10

If two different files result in the same hash, it is referred to as a ________.

key collision

coincidence

mistake

hash collision ( Correct )

Answer - When two different inputs yield the same hash, it is called a hash collision.
