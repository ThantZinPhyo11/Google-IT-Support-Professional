### Question 3

Which two of these are functions a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) can perform? 

Define the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates

Data binding and sealing ( Correct )

Remote attestation

Malware detection

Answer - TPMs can seal and bind data to them, encrypting data against the TPM. This also allows it to be decrypted by the TPM, if the machine isin a good and trusted state.


### Question 4

Which of these is a system that defines the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates? 

DSA

PKI ( Correct )

SHA-3 

CA

Answer - PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is a system that defines the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates.
