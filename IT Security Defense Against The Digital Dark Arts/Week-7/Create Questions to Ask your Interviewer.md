## Create Questions to Ask your Interviewer

### Question 1

In this exercise, you will create questions to ask a hypothetical interviewer. We will provide you with the general information you would like to know about a company or position. Then, you will create the question to help you learn the information. 


Are you ready to get started?

I’m ready!

### Question 2

You would like to know more about the attitudes and behaviors of the company and its employees. What question could you ask to learn more about this topic?


Answer - How does the company foster a positive work culture?
What are the company's core values, and how do they guide employee behavior?
How does the company handle conflict and difficult situations among employees?
What is the company's approach to employee training and development, and how does it impact employee behavior?
How does the company measure and recognize employee performance, and how does this impact employee attitudes and behaviors?
How does the company communicate with employees, and how does this impact employee engagement and job satisfaction?
How does the company support work-life balance and employee well-being, and how does this impact employee behavior and productivity?
What is the company's approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and how does it impact employee attitudes and behaviors?
How does the company encourage innovation and creativity among employees, and how does this impact employee behavior and job satisfaction?
How does the company handle feedback from employees, and how does this impact employee attitudes and behaviors?


### Question 3

You would like to better understand the tasks involved with the job and if you have the skills and experience to do the job well. What question could you ask to learn this information?

Answer - What are the key responsibilities of this position?
What skills and experience are required to perform this job successfully?
What are the most challenging aspects of this job?
Can you describe a typical day or week in this job?
What kind of support or training is provided to new hires?
What kind of tools or technology are used in this job?
What kind of performance metrics are used to evaluate success in this job?
What is the typical career path for someone in this role?
What are the most important qualities or attributes for someone to have in order to excel in this job?
Can you provide any examples of past successes in this role that might illustrate the kind of work I would be doing?


### Question 4

You’re concerned that the role you’re interviewing for has qualifications that do not precisely match your previous job experience. However, you believe you have nontraditional experiences that match the qualifications, such as from a side business. What question could you ask to clear up any concerns the interviewer may have about your background?


Answer - "Based on my resume and our discussion so far, are there any specific qualifications or experiences that you feel I may be lacking for this role?"

This question will give the interviewer an opportunity to raise any concerns they may have and allow you to address them directly. If they mention specific qualifications or experiences, you could then follow up with a statement such as:

"Although I may not have traditional experience in those areas, I do have experience from a side business where I gained skills and knowledge that are applicable to this role. For example, [provide specific examples of relevant experience from your side business]. Would you like me to elaborate on how this experience is relevant to this role?"

This approach will allow you to highlight your relevant experience and demonstrate your ability to transfer skills from one area to another, which can be an asset in many job roles.
