## Hands-on Activity: Adding Skills and Experience to your Resume

### Question 1

Which types of skills should you include in your resume’s skills section? Select all that apply.

Interpersonal skills

Technical skills ( Correct )

Data-related skills ( Correct )

Soft skills

Answer - To create a strong and effective skills section, you should include technical skills and IT support related skills. Soft skills and interpersonal skills are very important, but can be emphasized in other parts of your resume. Going forward, you can update the skills section as you grow as a data analyst to reflect what you’ve learned. This will help you create a resume that stands out to potential employers.


### Question 2

### Question 3

A Review of Best Practices

One of the most important functions of a resume is communicating your prior work experience to the reader in a favorable light. This can often be challenging, as the one-page format forces job seekers to summarize all of their work experience into a few bullet points. This can make it hard to know what should be included and what should be left off. 

These best practices will help you select the best parts of your work experience and communicate them in the shortest, most impactful way possible. 

As you think about how to represent your work experience on your resume effectively, remember the best practices you’ve learned:

Focus on your accomplishments first, and explain them using the formula “Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z.” 

These statements help you communicate the most important things a recruiter or hiring manager is searching for — the impact of your work.

 Whenever possible, use numbers to explain your accomplishments. For example, “[...] resulting in a 15% increase in productivity,” is better than “[...] resulting in an increase in productivity.”

Phrase your work experience and duties using Problem-Action-Result (PAR) statements. 

For example, instead of saying “Helped maintain the company database updated,” phrase it as “Saved the company over $50,000 in a weekend by fixing an error in the company database.” 

Use examples that highlight transferable skills or those skills that can transfer from one job or industry to another. 

This is especially important if you are transitioning from another industry into IT Support. 

For example, troubleshooting  is a skill often used in job descriptions for IT support specialists, so highlight examples from your work experience that demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively.

Don’t forget to highlight your soft skills.

These are non-technical traits and behaviors that relate to how you work.

 Are you detail-oriented? Do you have grit and perseverance? Are you a strong critical thinker? Do you have leadership skills? 

For instance, you could give an example of when you demonstrated leadership on the job.

Showing is always more effective than telling. 

This is almost always the hardest part of crafting a resume, especially if you are transitioning from a different career field. However, if you take a moment to think deeply about your previous work experience, you’ll likely discover that you can find ways to represent your work experiences in a way that highlights your ability to do things important to Data Analyst roles, like thinking critically, or making data-driven decisions. 

Get the interview, first

Remember that the goal of a resume is to get you an interview, not a job. You may find it challenging to compress all of the various responsibilities and accomplishments from previous jobs into a few bullet points. 

Effective resumes communicate that you are a candidate who understands the needs of the role and you have the skills and experience to warrant an interview. During interviews, you can expect questions about your experience and that’s when you can go into more detail.

Add your work experience

Now that you have had some time to think about your work experience, you should add it to your resume, keeping in mind the best practices we shared above and that creating a resume is a process. You’ll likely come back to work on it multiple times and change things like phrasing or formatting. With effort and time, you’ll eventually get your resume to a place where you’re satisfied with the final result. 

If you need inspiration or want to see how other data analysts have structured their resumes, take a moment to search for resumes of real data analysts. You can find these easily on sites such as LinkedIn. Seeing how other data analysts have structured and worded their own resumes may give you valuable insight about more effective ways to highlight your own experience!
