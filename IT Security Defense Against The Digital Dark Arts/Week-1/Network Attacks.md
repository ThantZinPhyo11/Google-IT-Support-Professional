# IT Security: Defense Against The Digital Dark Arts | Week-1

## Network Attacks

### Question 1

A person at a coffee shop leaves a laptop logged in with a token and walks away for a short time. An attacker goes to the laptop and starts impersonating the laptop’s user on the website the user is logged into. What kind of attack is this?

A trojan attack.

A session hijacking attack ( Correct )

A ransomware attack.

A rogue AP attack

Answer - An attacker sneaking into a session by stealing a token and impersonating a user is an example of a session hijacking.


### Question 2

Which one of these shows why a DNS cache poisoning attack is dangerous?

It lets attackers access a site’s database and cause damage by using database commands.

It's not actually dangerous.

It allows an attacker to redirect targets to malicious web servers. ( Correct )

It allows an attacker to remotely control your computer.

Answer - By inserting fake DNS records into a DNS server's cache, every client that queries this record will be redirected to a compromised web server, and fake, damaging sites run by attackers.


### Question 3

Which of the following is true of a DDoS attack? 

The attack is used to redirect web traffic to sites run by attackers.

The attack comes from one source sending a flood of SYN packets.

This type of attack is used to steal a token and hijack a session. 

The attack traffic comes from lots of different hosts.  ( Correct )

Answer - The "Distributed" in DDoS means that the attack traffic is distributed across a large number of hosts, resulting in the attack coming from many different machines.


### Question 4

Which one of the following results from a denial-of-service attack? 

Service unreachable ( Correct )

Malware infection

Email address theft

Data destruction

Answer - A denial-of-service attack is meant to prevent legitimate traffic from reaching a service. This is usually done by flooding the victim with attack traffic, which renders services unreachable.


### Question 5

Which of these describes a rogue AP attack? 

An employee at a company plugs a router into the company network to make a simple wireless network. An attacker standing outside the building takes advantage of this and goes onto the wireless network. ( Correct )

An attacker uses a form of malware to perform admin level modification to a victim’s operating system.

Company employees think they are connecting to the company network, but they are connecting to a fake, identical network controlled by an attacker.

A user tries to get to a service, but the service can’t be reached because an attacker has overloaded it with packets


Answer - This is an example of a rogue AP attack.
