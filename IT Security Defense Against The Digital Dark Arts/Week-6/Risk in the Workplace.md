# IT Security: Defense Against The Digital Dark Arts | Week-6

## Risk in the Workplace

### Question 1

What are some examples of security goals that you may have for an organization? Check all that apply. 

To deploy an Intrusion Prevention System

To protect customer data from unauthorized access  ( Correct )

To prevent unauthorized access to customer credentials  ( Correct )

To implement a strong password policy 

Answer - Great job! These are super important goals. Safeguards or systems should be implemented to help achieve them. It's important to distinguish between a discrete goal and the mechanisms or defense systems that help you to achieve these goals. Defenses on their own aren't goals, but they allow us to work towards these goals.


### Question 2

Which of these would you consider high-value targets for a potential attacker? Check all that apply. 

Authentication databases  ( Correct )

Networked printers 

Customer credit card information  ( Correct )

Logging server

Answer - That's right! Customer credit card data is really valuable to attackers, since it can be a hot commodity in the shadier areas of the internet. The same goes for authentication databases, since this could provide attackers with usernames and passwords that might give them access to accounts on other websites and services.


### Question 3

What's the purpose of a vulnerability scanner? 

It blocks malicious traffic from entering your network.

It fixes vulnerabilities on systems. 

It protects your network from malware. 

It detects vulnerabilities on your network and systems.  ( Correct )

Answer - Correct! A vulnerability scanner will scan and evaluate hosts on your network. It does this by looking for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities, then compiling a report with what it found.


### Question 4

What are some restrictions that should apply to sensitive and confidential data? Check all that apply. 

It can be stored on encrypted media only.  ( Correct )

It can be transferred via email.

It can be stored on removable media. 

It can be accessed and stored on personal devices. 

Answer - Nice work! Sensitive data should be treated with care so that an unauthorized third-party doesn't gain access. Ensuring this data is encrypted is an effective way to safeguard against unauthorized access.


### Question 5

What's a privacy policy designed to guard against? 

Denial-of-service attacks 

Attackers stealing customer data 

Eavesdropping on communications 

Misuse or abuse of sensitive data ( Correct )

Answer - Yep! Privacy policies are meant to govern the access and use of sensitive data for authorized parties.
