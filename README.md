Before talking about the lessons in the first course, I would like to recommend that you apply for financial aid and attend this course. Because the Google IT Support Certificate has (5) courses, and the duration of the course will be between 3 and 6 months, and if you pay for it, it will cost you (50) dollars a month. If calculated in Myanmar money, it will cost at least (3) to (5) hundred thousand. How to apply for Financial Aid so that you can attend all the courses (5) in Google IT-Support for free, I will soon post on my YouTube channel.

I would like to apply for one course after another without applying for financial aid for all (5) courses at the same time. Depending on the results of the assignment, I usually decide whether or not to approve additional courses for financial aid. If you apply for Financial Aid once, you have to wait 2 weeks for approval. Each course has weeks 1 to 6, and each week has assignments and labs. You can use the answers I answered to get good results for all Courses (5) if necessary. If you are lucky and ask the questions and answers that I have answered exactly (95%) I guarantee that you will pass. And follow the Financial Aid Application Letter as I wrote, and it must be approved. I attended all courses (5) for free through Finance Aid. In the Github folder, I have added everything from the answers to the questions to the final CV writing.

The certificate given by Google has been given credit to the University of London and the University of North Texas. A passport is required when the certificate is issued ( For Myanmar Citizen Only ). Registration (National ID) cannot be issued at all.
